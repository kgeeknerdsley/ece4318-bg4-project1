# ECE Student Calculator

Project 1 Code

Big Group 4, ECE 4318, Fall 2019

Group Leader: Kevin Worsley


For project 1, we developed a calculator that ECE students at Cal Poly would find useful. It is intended to be a utility that would be loaded onto lab computers, for example, providing a source of information without having to dig through Google or notebooks.

The calculator is written in C#, using Windows Forms Applications. It consists of a central form that spawns instances of other forms to start up the calculators. The program checks to ensure only one copy of a calculator is open at any given time, to prevent memory from filling up unnecessarily.
